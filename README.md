# React Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built using React. This game allows two players to compete against each other. The game board is displayed on the screen, and players can take turns clicking on the cells to place their marks (X or O). The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
